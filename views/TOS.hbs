            <h3>General Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability</h3>

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, ALGOLIFT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY, "<a href="javascript:void(0);">AFFILIATED PARTIES</a>") EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
              <p>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, ALGOLIFT AND ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (A) THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (B) THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (C) THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, (D) THE QUALITY OF ANY SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS, AND (E) ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM ALGOLIFT AND ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES OR ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>
              <p>ALGOLIFT AND ITS AFFILIATED PARTIES SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY LIABILITY (A) AS A PUBLISHER OF INFORMATION, (B) FOR ANY INCORRECT OR INACCURATE INFORMATION, (C) FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA, (D) FOR STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, OR (E) FOR ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES OR ANY THIRD PARTY WEBSITE OR APPLICATION.

          <div class="mb-20">
            <h3>Marketing</h3>

            <h3>Applicable Law</h3>
              <p>The Services are controlled and operated by AlgoLift from within the United States of America, and is intended for use only by residents of the United States. AlgoLift makes no representations or warranties that the content or materials of the Services are appropriate or lawful in any foreign countries, or that any items or applications offered for sale or download through links on the Services will be available outside the United States. Those who choose to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. You may not use or export or re-export any content downloaded from the Services or any copy or adaptation of such content, in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export laws and regulations.  If you reside outside of the United States, by using the Services, you consent to the transfer, processing and use of your information outside your country.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mb-20">
            <h3>Dispute Resolution, Arbritration Agreement and Class Waiver</h3>
              <p>You and AlgoLift agree that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), and not by any state law concerning arbitration; and that any dispute between us, including disputes by either of us against any agent, employee, subsidiary, affiliate, predecessor in interest, successor, or assign of the other, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration.</p>
              <p>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), and conducted under AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "AAA Rules") then in effect at the time of the dispute. You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879. If you initiate an arbitration, AlgoLift will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA's Procedures once you have notified AlgoLift, in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if AlgoLift is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to AlgoLift, including the $125 filing fee.</p>
              <p>There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis or in a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims against AlgoLift and may not preside over any kind of representative or class proceeding against AlgoLift. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST AlgoLift IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED A PRODUCT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND RETURN THE PRODUCT PURSUANT TO OUR RETURN POLICY TO GET A FULL REFUND.</p>
